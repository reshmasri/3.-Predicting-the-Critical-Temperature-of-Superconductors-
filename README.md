# Predicting-the-Critical-Temperature-of-Superconductors-

A superconductor is an important material
used in many practical applications. Depending on their
critical temperature they are used for various applications.
We used different machine learning regression and
classification techniques to determine the critical
temperature and its level of superconductivity. Regression
is used to predict 𝑻𝒄
(Critical Temperature ) and
classification to predict the level of superconductivity (Low
or high).The models used here are Decision Tree, Linear
regression, Support vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest
Neighbor (KNN), Gradient Boosting, bagging
